To promote accountability and help with privacy and compliance, Pryv.io enables you to generate audit logs. 

Let’s take a quick overview of what exactly are audit logs in Pryv.

An audit log shows “who” did “what” activity and “how” the system behaved.

The core benefits of collecting the data from your environement are numerous : 
- it helps you to capture a privileged activity information.
- it ensures that the system remains stable and users are held accountable for their actions, which are tracked by event logs. 
- it can be used to see when a user account may have been hacked, and then if user account privileges were escalated to access specific files or directories with sensitive information.

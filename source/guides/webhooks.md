Pryv.io supports webhook integration, and therefore allows to notify of data changes. 

Webhooks are one of a few ways web applications can communicate with each other.

It enables you to send real-time data from one application to another whenever a given event occurs.

For example, let’s imagine that you've created an application using Pryv.io API that tracks the number of steps your user does everyday and you want to be able to notify his doctor when the user reaches 10'000 steps during the day. 

What a webhook does is notify the receiving application any time the user does a certain number of steps, so you can run any processes that you had in your application once this event is triggered, and for example notify the doctor once 10'000 steps are being reached during the day.

The data is then sent over the web from the application where the event originally occurred (here the pedometer app), to the receiving application that handles the data.

Here’s a visual representation of what that looks like:

More information on how to set up a 'Webhook' on Pryv.io is provided in the corresponding section of the [API reference](https://api.pryv.com/reference/#webhook). 

Once created, webhooks will run and the exchange of data will happen over the web through a “webhook URL" that must be provided by the receiving application. Webhooks are executing a HTTP POST request to the provided URL for each data change in the user account, and this URL acts as a phone number that the other application can call when an event happens.

Importantly, only the app access used to create the webhook or a personal access can retrieve and modify it. This is meant to separate the responsibilities between the actor that sets the webhooks and the one(s) that consume the data following the webhook setup.

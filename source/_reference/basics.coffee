                 <pre><code>curl https://{token}@<span class="api">{username}.pryv.me</span>/access-info
                 </code></pre>

                 This method is not supported by modern browsers but by tools such as [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se), the Node.js library [superagent](https://visionmedia.github.io/superagent/) 
                 or [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com).

                 Note that Pryv.io does not require a username, so only the token should be Base64 encoded. For more information see [RFC671](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7617 ). 

                 2- The access token can be provided in the query string's `auth` parameter, for example during the Socket.IO handshake or for a direct HTTP GET call in a browser:
                 
                 <pre><code>curl https://{token}@<span class="api">{username}.pryv.me</span>/access-info?auth={token}

                 1. Choose an app identifier (min. length 6 chars)
                 2. Fetch the [service information](#service-info)
                 3. Send an [auth request](#auth-request) to the URL exposed by the **access** parameter of the service information
                 4. Open the `authUrl` field of the HTTP response in a browser or webframe. The web page will prompt the user to sign in using her Pryv.io credentials (or to create an account if she doesn't have one).
                 5. The result of the sign-in process: an authenticated Pryv API endpoint or a refusal can be obtained in two ways: 
                  - by [polling the URL](#poll-request) obtained in the `poll` field of the HTTP response to the auth request (preferred method)
                  - by being redirected to the `returnURL` provided in the auth request with the result in query parameters

                 #### Generate token app

                 The **Access token generator** is a simple web application that allows its user to enter the parameters of the [Auth request](#auth-request) and performs it. It is accessible at the following URL:

                 ```
                 https://api.pryv.com/app-web-access/?pryvServiceInfoUrl=${pryvServiceInfoUrl}
                 ```

                 For example:

                 [https://api.pryv.com/app-web-access/?pryvServiceInfoUrl=https://reg.pryv.me/service/info](https://api.pryv.com/app-web-access/?pryvServiceInfoUrl=https://reg.pryv.me/service/info)

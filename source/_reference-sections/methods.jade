  h2 Preliminary information
  section
    h3 Authorization
    .content
      :markdown
        All requests for retrieving and manipulating activity data must carry a valid [access token](#data-structure-access) in the HTTP `Authorization` header or, alternatively, in the query string's `auth` parameter.  (You get the token by using one of the [access SDKs](app-access.html) or from sharing.)

    aside
      :markdown
        #### Example with `Authorization` header
        ```http
        GET /events HTTP/1.1
        Host: yacinthe.pryv.io
        Authorization: {access-token}
        ```
        #### Example with `auth` query string parameter
        ```http
        GET /events?auth={access-token} HTTP/1.1
        Host: yacinthe.pryv.io
        ```

  section
    h3 Common errors
    .content
      :markdown
        #### Bad request `400`

        - `invalid-request-structure`: The request's structure is not that expected. This can happen e.g. with invalid JSON syntax, or when using an unexpected multipart structure for uploading file attachments.
        - `invalid-parameters-format`: The request's parameters do not follow the expected format. The error's `data` contains an array of validation errors.
        - `unknown-event`: The referenced event(s) can't be found. If relevant, the unknown items' ids are listed as an array in the error's `data.unknownIds`.
        - `unknown-stream`: The referenced stream(s) can't be found. If relevant, the unknown items' ids are listed as an array in the error's `data.unknownIds`.
        - `unknown-tag`: The referenced typed tag(s) can't be found. If relevant, the unknown items' ids are listed as an array in the error's `data.unknownIds`.

        #### Unauthorized `401`

        - `invalid-access-token`: The data access token is missing or invalid.

        #### Forbidden `403`

        The given access token does not grant permission for this operation. See [accesses](#data-structure-access) for more details about accesses and permissions.

        #### Not found `404`

        - `unknown-event`: The event can't be found.
        - `unknown-stream`: The activity stream can't be found.
        - `unknown-tag`: The tag can't be found.
        - `unknown-attachment`: The attached file can't be found for the specified event.

        And a couple of others, related to the status of the user's account:

        #### Moved `301`

        - `user-account-relocated`: The user has relocated her account to another Pryv server. Both the `Location` header and the error's `data` contain the equivalent URL pointing to the physical server now hosting the user's account. Note that this error can only occur between the moment the account is relocated and the moment your DNS is updated with the new server. So we're stretching the HTTP convention a little, in that the returned URL should not be used permanently (only until `{username}.pryv.io` points to the correct server again). You can decide whether you keep it for the duration of the session (if you have such a thing), for N hours, etc.

        #### Payment required `402`

        - `user-intervention-required`: We cannot serve the request at the moment, because the user's account has exceeded the limits of its plan. The user must log into Pryv to fix her account.

        ```

  section.method
    h3 Create event
    .content
      :markdown
        `POST /events`, Socket.IO: `events.create`

        Records a new event. It is recommended that events recorded this way are completed events, i.e. either period events with a known duration or mark events. To start a running period event, use [Start period](#TODO) instead.

        In addition to JSON, this request accepts standard multipart/form-data content to support the creation of event with attached files in a single request. When sending a multipart request, one content part must hold the JSON for the new event and all other content parts must be the attached files.

        #### Body parameters

        The new event's data: see [Event](#data-structure-event).

        #### Successful response: `201 Created`

        - `id` ([identity](#data-structure-identity)): The new event's id.
        - `stoppedId` ([identity](#data-structure-identity)): Only in `singleActivity` streams. If set, indicates the id of the previously running period event that was stopped as a consequence of inserting the new event.

        #### Specific errors

        - `400 Bad Request`, id `invalid-operation`: The stream is in the trash, and we prevent the recording of new events into trashed streams.
        - `400 Bad request`, id `periods-overlap`: Only in `singleActivity` streams: the new event overlaps existing period events. The overlapped events' ids are listed as an array in the error's `data.overlappedIds`.

    aside
      :markdown
        #### cURL example

        ```bash
        curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"streamId":"{stream-id}"}' https://{username}.pryv.io/events?auth={access-token}
        ```

  section.method
    h3 Start period
    .content
      :markdown
        `POST /events/start`, Socket.IO: `events.start`

        Starts a new period event. This is equivalent to starting an event with a null `duration`. In `singleActivity` streams, also stops the previously running period event if any. See [Create event](#TODO) for details.

    aside
      :markdown
        #### cURL example

        ```bash
        curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"streamId":"{stream-id}"}' https://{username}.pryv.io/events/start?auth={access-token}
        ```

  section.method
    h3 Stop period
    .content
      :markdown
        `POST /events/stop`, Socket.IO: `events.stop`

        Stops a previously running period event. In `singleActivity` streams, which guarantee that only one event is running at any given time, that event is automatically determined; for regular streams, the event to stop must be specified.

        #### Body parameters

        - `streamId` ([identity](#data-structure-identity)): The id of the `singleActivity` stream in which to stop any running event. Either this or `id` must be specified.
        - `id` ([identity](#data-structure-identity)): The id of the event to stop. Either this or `streamId` must be specified.
        - `time` ([timestamp](#data-structure-timestamp)): Optional. The stop time. Default: now.

        #### Successful response: `200 OK`

        - `stoppedId` ([identity](#data-structure-identity)): The id of the previously running period event that was stopped, or null if no running event was found.

        #### Specific errors

        - `400 Bad Request`, id `unknown-event`: The specified event cannot be found.
        - `400 Bad Request`, id `invalid-operation`: The specified event is not a running period event.
        - `400 Bad Request`, id `missing-parameter`: No event was specified and the specified stream is not a `singleActivity` stream (so that there can be more than one running event).

        Modifies the event's attributes.

        #### Body parameters

        New values for the event's fields: see [event](#data-structure-event). All fields are optional, and only modified values must be included. TODO: example

        #### Successful response: `200 OK`

        - `stoppedId` ([identity](#data-structure-identity)): If set, indicates the id of the previously running period event that was stopped as a consequence of modifying the event.

        #### Specific errors

        - `400 Bad Request`, id `invalid-operation`: Returned for period events, if attempting to set the event's duration to `undefined` (i.e. still running) while one or more other period events were recorded after it. The error's `data.conflictingPeriodId` provides the id of the closest conflicting event.
        - `400 Bad Request`, id `periods-overlap`: Returned for period events, if attempting to change the event's duration to a value that causes an overlap with one or more subsequent period event(s). The overlapped events' ids are listed as an array in the error's `data.overlappedIds`.

  section.method
    h3 Delete event
    .content
      :markdown
        `DELETE /events/{event-id}`, Socket.IO: `events.del`

        Trashes or deletes the specified event, depending on its current state:

        - If the event is not already in the trash, it will be moved to the trash (i.e. flagged as `trashed`)
        - If the event is already in the trash, it will be irreversibly deleted (including all its attached files, if any).

  section.method
    h3 Batch-create events
    .content
      :markdown
        `POST /events/batch`, Socket.IO: `events.createBatch`

        Batch upload events that were recorded by the client while offline. The submitted events are added in-order, with results returned individually for each (see response below).

        #### Body parameters

        An array of client-recorded [events](#data-structure-event). In addition to the regular properties, each event must have a unique `tempRefId` defined (as it's temporary it must only be unique within the request). Also, make sure that the events' `time` is set in server time (as for single event requests).

        #### Successful response: `200 OK`

        An object with one property per event submitted holding the result for that event. Each property's name is the submitted event's client id, and its value contains:

        - If the event was successful created, an object with the `id` of the event, and possibly the `stoppedId` of the running period event that was stopped as a result. (For details, see POST `/events`.)
        - If there was an error creating the event: an object with an `error` property holding the encountered [error](#data-structure-error).

        - If the stream is not already in the trash, it will be moved to the trash (i.e. flagged as `trashed`)
        - If the stream is already in the trash, it will be irreversibly deleted with its possible descendants. If events exist that refer to the deleted item(s), you must indicate how to handle them with the parameter `mergeEventsWithParent`..

        #### Parameters

        - `mergeEventsWithParent` (`true` or `false`): Required if actually deleting the item and if it (or any of its descendants) has linked events, ignored otherwise. If `true`, the linked events will be assigned to the parent of the deleted item; if `false`, the linked events will be deleted.

      While full access management is reserved for trusted apps, any app can retrieve and manage shared accesses depending on its own permissions. All methods here only deal with shared accesses whose permissions are a subset of that linked to the token used for the requests. (You'll get a `403 Forbidden` error if trying to touch other types of accesses, or shared accesses with greater permissions.)

section
  h2 <a id="activity-profile-app"></a>App profile
  .intro
    :markdown
      The app profile is a simple key-value store available for your app to keep user settings. It is exposed as a plain object with free structure. The adding/updating/deleting of settings is designed in the expectation that each setting is a key at the profile object's root, but you can structure your profile differently if you wish.

      The app profile can only be used if authentified with an app access token.

  section.method
    h3 Get app settings
    .content
      :markdown
        `GET /profile/app`

        Gets your app profile settings.

        #### Successful response: `200 OK`

        An object containing your app's current profile settings. The method always returns an object (which will be empty if your app never defined any setting).

  section.method
    h3 Update profile settings
    .content
      :markdown
        `PUT /profile/app`

        Adds, updates or delete settings.

        - To add or update a setting, just set its value
        - To delete a field, set its value to `null`

        Settings you don't specify in the update are left untouched.

        #### Parameters

        An object with the desired changes to the settings (see above).

        #### Successful response: `200 OK`

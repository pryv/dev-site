## Wish list

- **CalDAV**; sync to Apple/Google calendars etc. would be pretty easy (at least one-way)
- **E-mail**; that could be done several ways, such as an IMAP service (for existing email clients to tap into) or a client app (or integration into an existing client) pulling mail from a POP server
- **Blogging**; using Pryv as store for a blogging engine, either directly (probably with caching of some sort) or via syncing. A very minimal personal blog thing would be simple enough to implement, but one could also try forking an existing engine.
- **Personal finance tracking**
- **Time tracking**; historically one of the first apps envisioned, and a natural fit for the API
- More integrations with existing services (one-way or bidirectional)

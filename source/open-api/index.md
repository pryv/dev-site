# Usage

## Postman

### Import

The OpenAPI description of Open-Pryv.io or Pryv.io Entreprise can be directly imported into Postman to test the API's functionality. 


- **1.** If Postman has not yet been installed on your computer, you can download it from [here](http://www.getpostman.com). 
- **2.** In the Postman app, click `Import` to bring up the following screen:

![Import on Postman](/assets/images/import.png)

You can choose to upload a file, enter a URL, or copy the YAML file on Postman. 

Import the `open-api-format/api.yaml` from the [URL link](/open-api/3.0/api.yaml) or the YAML file directly with `Import as an API` and `Generate a Postman Collection` checked.
If you are using the Open Source version of Pryv.io, import the `open-api-format/api_open.yaml` from the [URL link](/open-api/3.0/api_open.yaml).

### Environment

- **3.** In the top right corner of Postman, click on the eye icon to see the Environment Options and `Add` a new active Environment for Pryv :

![Add the Environment](/assets/images/add.png)

- **4.** Set the environment variables of Pryv. 

Fill in the variable `baseUrl` as shown below:

![Manage the Environment](/assets/images/manage.png)

The variable `baseUrl` should be set as `https://{{token}}@{{username}}.pryv.me`, with the variables `username` and `token` corresponding to the username and access token of your Pryv account.
You can find more information on how to create a Pryv user on the [dedicated page](http://api.pryv.com/getting-started/#create-a-pryv-lab-user), and obtain an Access Token from the [Pryv Access Token Generator](https://api.pryv.com/app-web-access/?pryvServiceInfoUrl=https://reg.pryv.me/service/info).

In our example, the `username` "testuser" associated to the `token` "cdtasdjhashdsa" are used to set the `baseUrl` variable as `https://cdtasdjhashdsa@testuser.pryv.me`.

**Note that you should remove trailing slash for the variable `baseUrl` to have a working environment.**

Finally, click on `Add` to update the environment.

### Testing the API

- **5.** Once the Pryv environment is set, you can get familiar with Pryv.io API by testing different methods :

![Open API methods](/assets/images/play.png)

Select a method by directly clicking on it.

For `GET` methods, you can check or uncheck the Query Params you need, and fill them with the right value in the `Params` field.

As an example, see the method `events.get` below :

![events.get](/assets/images/get-events.png)

For `POST` and `PUT` methods, you should fill the necessary parameters in the `Body` field.

As an example, the different parameters `name`, `parentId`, etc. should be completed with their own value when creating a new stream for the method `streams.create` below :

![events.get](/assets/images/create-streams.png)

- **6.** Once you have filled in the necessary fields for the method you are testing, click on `Send` to send the request :

![Send request](/assets/images/send.png) 

- **7.** Enjoy !

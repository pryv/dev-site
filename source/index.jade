        ## Events for anything, contextualized

        Collect data and/or build meaning across multiple streams, whatever their source.

        Personal metrics, location, pictures, audio, notes, activities, vegetable garden yields, you name it: if it’s got a time, it can be a Pryv event. With an open directory of event types bound to evolve with the needs of the community, you set the limits.

        ## Events for anything, contextualized

        Collect data and/or build meaning across multiple streams, whatever their source.

        Personal metrics, location, pictures, audio, notes, activities, vegetable garden yields, you name it: if it’s got a time, it can be a Pryv event. With an open directory of event types bound to evolve with the needs of the community, you set the limits.

        ## We're currently in beta

        That means the content here is still rather minimal, and that the API may still undergo a few changes before it reaches "v1.0". We'll publish a roadmap, but in the meantime we're glad to read your feedback and expectations via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/pryv/dev-site/issues) or [e-mail](mailto:developers@pryv.com).

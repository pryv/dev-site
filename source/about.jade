    # About the API

    [Pryv](#TODO-link-to-front-site) is a service empowering people with
    a simple, trusted space where the manyÂ heterogeneous streams that make up their digital identity
    are reunited under their control.
    It handles any type of timestamped data, modeling individual pieces as *events* and
    contextualizing them into *streams*.

    The Pryv API is an HTTP and web sockets API that enables apps & services to interact with Pryv
    events and streams.

    ## The basics

    Pryv is a decentralized service, with each user account served by the server storing its data.
    There can be as many servers as there are accounts.

    Users collect, manipulate and view events on their account (or other users' accounts) via apps,
    which are granted access to the parts of user data they need (e.g. specific streams). Apps
    can interoperate provided they support the same event types and are granted access to the same
    data.

    Stored data is private by default. Users share data by explicitly opening read-only or
    collaborative accesses to specific parts of their data.

    ## Why we made it

    There is a definite convergence towards reuniting people's data into a single space and
    towards more privacy and user control. This is happening, for the good. On the one hand, new
    apps and services now pop up regularly, each with their own angle on the matter
    (journaling, lifelogging/quantified self, travelling, etc.). On the other, initiatives such as
    [Tent](https://tent.io) aim to define the decentralized protocol that will bind all of this
    together and hand ultimate control to the user. Here we stand:

    - We believe a service reuniting a person's most personal data must provide hard-core
      guarantees about privacy, ownership and control, and that this can only be truly achieved
      with data decentralization (on the technical side) and full transparency and openness (on the
      business side).
    - We believe [our take on visualizing and browsing this data](#TODO) is appropriate and unique.
    - We believe in the advent of an open protocol ultimately, and we will work to support that,
      but we think app developers need a simple and friendly platform to build on today.
      We also want to help shaping this future protocol by example.
    - Building such a platform is what we do, and we do it upfront. We are not trying to pull out the
      next great lifelogging or social app to get hundreds of thousands of users on board first,
      as we think this would only distract us from our goal.
      We believe that pursuing this goal passionately, openly and transparently has all the power we
      need to federate a community of like-minded developers building a new breed of user-centric
      apps.

    ## What you can build with it

    Despite the name, which reflect our primary intent to stand for user privacy and control, you
    can build mostly anything on top of the API. We recommend the use of standard streams and
    event types to foster interoperability, but this is by no means an obligation.
    What we *hope* you'll build, though, are apps and services that work to help people reclaim
    control over their digital lives, cultivating simplicity, honesty and trust, and putting human
    relationships at the forefront.

    But whatever you create will build on a fundamental principle, which can represent a
    significant change of perspective: users own and control their data here. Pryv ensures that
    apps are built with the sole focus of bringing true value to users, to avoid users
    ever becoming the product again. *TODO: link to the future charter of Pryv app development*

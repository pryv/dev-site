      Pryv.io is a middleware which aims to provide personal data management.  

      As a middleware, Pryv.io does not provide User Interfaces (UI), nor physical storage or infrastructure.
      The system is composed of several components being:

        1. One or multiple core components: responsible for the core functionalities such as data storage and access control.

        2. One or multiple register components: responsible for linking a data subjectâ€™s storage to the corresponding core component responsible for its data management.

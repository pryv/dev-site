In this tutorial, we will help you to get started with Pryv.io. You can try out and evaluate Pryv.io API for your projects using either our [Lab platform](https://pryv.com/pryvlab/) or the Open source version of Pryv.io available [here](https://github.com/pryv/open-pryv.io). 

We will guide you through:

1. [Create a Pryv Lab user](#create-a-pryv-lab-user)
2. [Create an Open Pryv.io user](#create-an-open-pryv-io-user)
3. [Obtain an Access Token](#obtain-an-access-token)
4. [Data Modelling](#data-modelling)
5. [Access Management](#access-management)
6. [What's next](#what-is-next)

In addition, you can download the [OpenAPI document](/open-api/3.0/api.yaml) describing the Pryv.io API using the OpenAPI Specification and import it on other testing platforms for API such as Postman, as explained on our [Open API page](/open-api/).

# Create a Pryv Lab user

By registering on our Lab platform, you will have access to a Pryv.io user account in a fully-functional environment perfect for your first tests.

1. Go to the blabl [registration page](https://sw.pryv.me/access/register.html)\
<br />
<br />

![Register-lab.html](/assets/images/getting-started/register-lab.png =210x)
2. Fill in the form and choose [where you want to store your data](/concepts/#servers) under 'Hosting'.

![Hosting](/assets/images/getting-started/hosting.png)
3. Click on the '**Create**' button.


*Data in Pryv.io has a geographical location that doesn't change. This makes it easier to control what legislations apply.*

Note that the email is optional for the account creation, but is required to reset your password.

Once this is done, you will receive a welcome email from the **Pryv Lab** with your account details. You can sign in to your Pryv.io account on the following link: [https://sw.pryv.me/access/access.html](https://sw.pryv.me/access/access.html).

![Sign-in](/assets/images/getting-started/sign-in.png)

You have now access to your Pryv Lab account through the Pryv.io demo dashboard web application.

## Pryv demo Dashboard

The Pryv demo dashboard is a data visualization tool. 

![Dashboard Image](/assets/images/getting-started/dashboard-image-git.png)

It enables you to visualize the "events" you created, corresponding to timestamped data - that can be in the form of notes, images, GPS location, data points, etc - and to organize them into "streams", while managing the access level to this data.
To get more information on the Pryv data model of events and streams, you can jump to the [**dedicated chapter**](#data-modelling).

The dashboard offers a visual display of the data you will create and add to your account throughout this guide. 
As shown below, once you connect to your account, the home page of your dashboard displays the list of streams of your account, where a default stream `Diary` is automatically created.

![Pryv Lab Dashboard: Streams](/assets/images/getting-started/streams_dashboard.png)

You can easily add content (notes, pictures, positions) directly from the dashboard and select in which stream to put it.
Once data is added to your account, you can select which streams to visualize on the dashboard and which time period to display by using the scroll bar on the bottom of the dashboard.

![Johann Dashboard](/assets/images/getting-started/dashboard_johann.png)

# Create an Open Pryv.io user

You should first setup the installation of your own Open Pryv.io platform by following the guidelines in the README.md of the [Github repo](https://github.com/pryv/open-pryv.io).

Once your platform is up and running, you can create a user account and launch the authentication process.

1. Test your Open Pryv.io locally by running `yarn local` in your terminal
2. Open the registration page on the following link : https://my-computer.rec.la:4443/www/access/register.html. 
![Register-open.html](/assets/images/getting-started/register-open.png =210x)
3. Fill in the form and click on the '**Create**' button.

You can now sign in to your Open Pryv.io account on the following link: [https://my-computer.rec.la:4443/www/access/access.html](https://my-computer.rec.la:4443/www/access/access.html).

# Obtain an Access Token

Now that your Pryv.io account has been created using either Pryv lab or Open Pryv.io, you can start adding data. In order to do so by using code or API clients such as cURL or Postman, you first need to obtain an access token.

The easiest is to use the **Pryv Access Token Generation** page (which is a raw implementation of [Pryv.io's oAuth-like process](/reference/#authenticate-your-app)).

1. Go to the [Pryv Access Token Generation page: https://api.pryv.com/app-web-access/](https://api.pryv.com/app-web-access/)
2. Set up the required parameters :

   1. Fill in the Service Info URL related to your Pryv.io platform:
   - with Pryv Lab 
   ![Service Info Pryv Lab](/assets/images/getting-started/service-info-lab.png)
   - with Open Pryv.io
   ![Service Info Open Pryv](/assets/images/getting-started/service-info-open.png)
   2. Enter the Application ID (ex.: `app-web-access-test`)
   2. Setup the streams you want to grant access to in the permissions box
      ![Permissions Box](/assets/images/getting-started/permissions.png)

      ```json
      [
        {
          "streamId": "heart",
          "defaultName": "Heart",
          "level": "read"
        }
      ]
      ```

   3. Click on '**Request Access**' button

3. After requesting access, you can click on the '**Login**' button ![Login Button](/assets/images/getting-started/login-open-pryv.png) - A new tab will open to log in to your Pryv Lab or Open Pryv.io account
4. Sign in with your Pryv Lab or Open Pryv.io credentials
   ![Sign In Dialog](/assets/images/getting-started/sign-in.png)
   A popup will open to inform you about the access you are about to grant.
5. Answer the App Access request

   By accepting, you consent that the 'app-web-access-test' application can access the stream `Heart` with a "manage" access level. Since this stream doesn't exist yet, it will be automatically created and carry the name we provided in the `defaultName` parameter above.

   For now, you just have to understand that we are generating a token that gives enough permissions to interact with our Pryv.io account in the scope of our example. You will learn more about accesses in the [Access Management chapter](#access-management).

   ![Accept Button](/assets/images/getting-started/consent.png)

6. **The API endpoint for the user account has been generated.** 
Each user account has a dedicated root API endpoint that is potentially served from a different location. 
The API endpoint will have the following format :
- For a Pryv Lab account with username `demopryv123`:
![Access Token](/assets/images/getting-started/access-token.png)
- For an Open Pryv.io account with username `helloworld`:
![Access Token Open Pryv](/assets/images/getting-started/access-token-open.png)

# Data Modelling

In this section, we provide you information on the basic concepts of the Pryv.io data model.
When adding data to your account, you need to comply with Pryv's conventions by organizing it into "streams" and "events".

To see examples and possible scenarios you might encounter, please check the [**dedicated page**](/guides/data-modelling) to learn how the data model should be structured and implemented depending on your use case.

The Pryv.io data model is composed of two entities: **events** and **streams**.   

All the data that you collect and aggregate should follow an organisation in streams and events. 
Inside each stream can be found timestamped events : 

![Pryv.io Data Model](/assets/images/data_model_allergens.svg)

### Streams

**Streams** are the main way of encoding context for events and are organised in a hierarchical way. They can have sub-streams and usually correspond to organizational levels for the user (e.g. life journal, blood pressure recording, etc.) or encode data sources (e.g. apps and/or devices).

![Stream example](/assets/images/getting-started/stream_level_1.png)

Here is an example of a **stream** with sub-streams (children): the **Digital Tensiometer** has a dedicated substream, which collects "events" such as the blood pressure measurements and adds them in the substream `blood-pressure`.

```json
{
  "id": "health-profile",
  "name": "Health Profile",
  "parentId": null,
  "created": 1528445539.785,
  "createdBy": "cji5os3u11ntt0b40tg0xhfea",
  "modified": 1528445581.592,
  "modifiedBy": "cjhagb5up1b950b40xsbeh5yj",
  "children": [
    {
      "id": "digital-tensiometer",
      "name": "Digital Tensiometer",
      "parentId": "health-profile",
      "created": 1528445684.508,
      "createdBy": "cji5os3u11ntt0b40tg0xhfea",
      "modified": 1528445684.508,
      "modifiedBy": "cji5os3u11ntt0b40tg0xhfea",
      "children": [
        {
          "id": "blood-pressure",
          "name": "Blood Pressure",
          "parentId": "digital-tensiometer",
          "created": 1528445704.807,
          "createdBy": "cji5os3u11ntt0b40tg0xhfea",
          "modified": 1528445704.807,
          "modifiedBy": "cji5os3u11ntt0b40tg0xhfea",
          "children": []
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Events

**Events** are the primary unit of content in Pryv.io. An event is a timestamped piece of typed data, and always occurs in one stream. 
Events either have a type from the list of [**standard event types**](/event-types/#directory) to allow interoperability, or an application-specific type. 

Our user will therefore be adding events of different types, each related to specific streams:

![Pryv.io Data Model](/assets/images/data_model_allergens.svg)

Here's an example of an event, corresponding to the heart rate collected by a **Digital Tensiometer** and added in the substream `heart` as described in the streams structure above :

```json
{
  "id": "cji5pfumt1nu90b40chlpetyp",
  "streamIds": ["heart"],
  "type": "blood-pressure/mmhg-bpm",
  "content": {
    "systolic": 120,
    "diastolic": 80,
    "rate": 90
  },
  "time": 1528446260.693
}
```

Pryv offers the possibility to manipulate a broad range of event types that can be all found in the [**event type directory**](/event-types/). You can also create your custom event types for your own use case as explained in the Github repo [here](https://github.com/pryv/data-types).

**Basic event types** include :
- [**numerical values**](/event-types/#numerical-types) to capture number values. For example, the type `density/kg-m3` can be used to record the density of a material. In the case of our user, we can use this type to reflect the exposure to specific allergens in his daily life.

```json
{
  "id": "c3jkdjdt000ze64d8u9z4hap",
  "streamIds": ["pollen"],
  "type": "density/kg-m3",
  "content": 850,
  "time": 1589358119.329
}
```

- [**complex types**](/event-types/#complex-types), which will be relevant for specific activities and measurements. In the use case above, the type `blood-pressure/bpm-mmhg` can be used to record a blood pressure measurement. It will represent an object, the blood pressure measurement, that has three properties : the systolic and diastolic blood pressure stored in **mmHg**, and the heart rate in **bpm**.

```json
{
  "id": "c4jghrjkj011ez46d8u4y3pah",
  "streamIds": ["heart"],
  "type": "blood-pressure/bpm-mmhg",
  "content": {
      "systolic": 120, 
      "diastolic": 80, 
      "rate": 95
      },
  "time": 1682359123.3923
}
```

More specific event types also involve :

**Attachments** that can be added to events, for example for our user to post pictures of his nutrition in a dedicated substream under his `Health Profile` stream. 
![Attachment](/assets/images/getting-started/attachment.png)

These events will have the type `picture/attached` :

```json
{
  "id": "ck2bzkjdt000ze64d8u9z4pha",
  "streamIds": ["nutrition"],
  "type": "picture/attached",
  "content": null,
  "time": 1572358119.329,
  "attachments": [
    {
      "id": "ck2bzkjdt000ze64d8u9z4pha",
      "fileName": "meal1.jpg",
      "type": "image/jpeg",
      "size": 2561,
      "readToken": "ck2bzkjdt0010e64dwu4sy8fe-3yTvQTD630qVT4qBFYtWDwrQ8mb"
    }
  ]
}
```

**High-frequency series** that can be used to collect a high volume of data. This data structure, described in the [**corresponding section**](/reference/#data-structure-high-frequency-series), is used for high frequency data to resolve issues with data density. In our example, it can be used for the smartwatch to collect GPS position in real-time of the user. 
![HF](/assets/images/getting-started/hf-event.png)

This data will have the type `position/wgs84` :

```json
{
  "id": "ck2klss8v00124yjx45s3jp5r",
  "time": 1572882785.023,
  "streamIds": ["position"],
  "type": "series:position/wgs84",
  "content": {
    "elementType": "position/wgs84",
    "fields": [
      "deltaTime",
      "latitude",
      "longitude"
    ],
  }
}
```

More information on HF series is provided in the [**API reference**](/reference-preview/#hf-series).

To get more details on all possible event types, see the [**events API reference**](/reference/#event).

# Access Management

You might want to give permissions to applications and third-parties to access and manage your account (by reading or adding new data).

In a previous [section](#obtain-an-access-token), we generated a token to be able to give access to Pryv.io user account to an app or a trusted third party of our choice. This token represents the access your application has to a user account; it only expires when the user retracts his consent. 
This token should be stored permanently and securely in your application.

Pryv.io enables you to define accesses with different levels of permissions for third-parties to interact with your data, or only particular folders of your data.

Let's imagine that our user wants his doctor Tom to give him feedback on his daily allergen exposure. The streams structure will then look like the following :

![Example with doctor feedback](/assets/images/data_model_allergens_doctor.svg)

To do so, he needs to give permission to the doctor Tom to "read" the data from the stream `Allergen exposure App` and to "manage" the streams `Doctor's feedback` in which he will be adding his feedback, and `Health Profile` in which he will record events related to his patient's health. The level "manage" will enable Tom to fully control the stream and to add his comments as new events in the stream `Comment`. 

The access for doctor Tom will be created by a `POST` call on accesses (see [accesses.create](/reference/#create-access)):

```json
{
  "name": "For Doctor Tom",
  "permissions": [
    {
      "streamId": "allergen-exposure-app",
      "level": "read"
    },
    {
      "streamId": "health-profile",
      "level": "manage"
    },
    {
      "streamId": "doctor-feedback",
      "level": "manage"
    }
  ]
}
```

Thus, each access is defined by a "name", a set of "permissions" and a "type" that is optional.

Pryv.io distinguishes between three access types ("shared", "app" and "personal") which are explained in the [corresponding section](/concepts/#accesses).

As you can see from the example above, each permission specifies a `streamId`, the id of the stream to which we want to give access, and an access `level`, which can be one of the following:
- `read`: Enables users to view the stream and its contents (sub-streams and events).
- `contribute`: Enables users to contribute to one or multiple events of the stream. Cannot create, update, delete and move streams.
- `manage`: Enables users to fully control the stream. Can create, update, delete and move the stream.
- `create-only`: Enables users to read the stream and create events on it and its children.

A more exhaustive explanation of the concept of "Access" and the different "levels" of permissions can be found in the [API reference](/reference/#access).

    # About the API

    [Pryv](#TODO-link-to-front-site) is a service to empower people with a simple, trusted space
    where the manyÂ heterogeneous streams that make up their digital identity are reunited under
    their control. It can store any type of timestamped data, modeling individual pieces as *events*
    and contextualizing them into *streams*.

    The Pryv API is an HTTP and web sockets API that enables apps & services to interact with Pryv
    events and streams.

    ## The basics

    Each user account is served by the Pryv server which stores its data. There can be as many
    servers as there are accounts.

    Users collect, manipulate and view events on their account (or other users' accounts) via apps,
    which are granted access to the parts of user data they need (e.g. specific streams). Apps
    can interoperate provided they support the same event types and are granted access to the same
    data.

    Stored data is private by default. Users share data by explicitly opening read-only or
    collaborative accesses to specific parts of their data.

    ## What you can build with it

    Despite the name, which reflect our primary intent to stand for user privacy and control, you
    can build mostly anything on top of the API. We recommend the use of standard streams and
    event types to foster interoperability, but this is by no means an obligation.

    What we *hope* you'll build, though, are apps and services that work to help people reclaim
    control over their digital lives, cultivating simplicity, honesty and trust, and placing human
    relationships at the forefront.

    ## Why we made it

    There is a definite convergence towards reuniting people's data into a single space and
    towards more privacy and user control. This is happening, and for the good. On the one hand, new
    apps and services now pop up regularly, each with their own angle on the matter
    (journaling, lifelogging/quantified self, travelling, etc.). On the other, initiatives such as
    [Tent](https://tent.io) aim to define the decentralized protocol that will bind all of this
    together and hand ultimate control to the user. Here we stand:

    - We believe a service reuniting a person's most personal data must provide hard-core
      guarantees about privacy, ownership and control, and that this can only be truly achieved
      with data decentralization (on the technical side) and full transparency and openness (on the
      business side).
    - We believe [our take on visualizing and browsing this data](#TODO) is appropriate and unique.
    - We believe in the ultimate advent of an open protocol, but that app developers need a simple and
      friendly platform to build on today. We also want to help shaping this future protocol by
      example.
    - We believe this can federate like-minded developers to build a new breed of apps on our platform
      without having to attract them with hundreds of thousands of existing users.

    # Welcome developers

    TODO: rewrite this page a quick introduction, visuals and a link to the 'about' page

    This is the future site for Pryv developers. It is work-in-progress, bare-bones stuff but should
    be enough to get you going, with our support of course
    (just <a href="mailto:developers@pryv.com">contact us</a> if you need help).

    ## Quick notes

    - API URL: Due to the stage of development we're in, the frequent changes and the confidential
      number of developers working with us, we recommend everyone to use our staging API at
      `https://{username}.rec.la`, which matches the information on the present site.
      (The production API on `pryv.io` is updated much less often.)
    - [Here's where to create a user on the staging environment](https://sw.rec.la/access/register.html)

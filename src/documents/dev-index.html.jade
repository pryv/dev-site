    # Welcome developers

    TODO: rewrite this page a quick introduction, visuals and a link to the 'about' page

    This is the future site for Pryv developers. It is a work-in-progress.

    It's bare-bones stuff but should be enough to get you going, with our support of course
    (just <a href="mailto:developers@pryv.com">contact us</a> if you need help).

    ## A quick word on the API URL

    Due to the stage of development we're in, the frequent changes and the confidential number
    of developers working with us, we recommend everyone to use our staging API at
    `https://{username}.rec.la`, which matches the information on the present site.
    (The production API on `pryv.io` is updated much less often.)

    [Create a user on the staging servers](https://sw.rec.la/access/register.html)

    ## News

    You can follow the latest updates on [our temporary developers blog](http://dev-blog.pryv.com),
    or subscribe to the [newsfeed](http://dev-blog.pryv.com/feed).

    Yes we've ditched e-mail for notifications for now, and we're interested in knowing how
    you'd prefer being notified of news (just RSS? Twitter? e-mail?):
    <a href="mailto:developers@pryv.com">tell us</a>. Thanks in advance.

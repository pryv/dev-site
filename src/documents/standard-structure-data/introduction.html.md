# Introduction

In this section, we introduce the default channels and folders that are present in a user's pryv storage. You can choose in which folder and channel to save the events created by your app, according to the descriptions below.

Should there be no adequate channel or folder for your specific purposes, it is possible to add custom ones, see the [APIÂ reference](reference.html).

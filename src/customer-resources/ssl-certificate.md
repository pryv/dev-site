This document describes how to generate a wildcard SSL certificate using [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) and Pryv.io's DNS.

As prerequisite, you must haveâ€¦
- [obtained a domain name](/customer-resources/pryv.io-setup/#obtain-a-domain-name),
- and [installed the Pryv.io platform](/customer-resources/pryv.io-setup/#set-the-platform-parameters).

If you are using an infrastructure with appliances that perform the SSL termination, you can simply adapt the NGINX configuration files to listen on port 80 and not perform encryption.

## Automatic generation with Pryv.io 1.7.4 or later

If you are running Pryv.io 1.7.4 or later, you can simply run the `renew-ssl-certificate` script provided with [the configuration files](https://pryv.github.io/config-template-pryv.io/) to generate a SSL certificate for your Pryv.io platform.

Note: from version 1.9.0 it's required to set a valid email address in the configuration file `config-leader/ssl/conf/ssl-certificate.yml`

Otherwise, follow this guide.

### DNS check failure: Error: Servers are not reachable

If you encounter this error, your network settings might prevent the `renewl-ssl-certificate` tool from peforming the pre-check of DNS challenge, namely the node process inside the `pryvio_ssl_certificate` container cannot get an answer from the `pryvio_dns` container.

You can simply skip this by modifying the `acme:skipDnsChecks` parameter in `config-leader/ssl/conf/ssl-certificate.yml`. You can also increase the value of the time allocated for the DNS container(s) to reboot by increasing the `acme:dnsRebootWaitMs` parameter. On machines with limited resources, you can increase this value to `10000` (10 seconds).


## Manual generation with Pryv 1.7.3 or earlier

Unless specified otherwise, the steps are to be performed on the single-node or `reg-master` machine, depending on your setup. Certbot can be installed and run anywhere, of course.

### Install Certbot

- [Reference](https://certbot.eff.org/lets-encrypt/ubuntuxenial-other)

This procedure describes the commands for Ubuntu 18.04.
If you are using another OS, go to the reference link, choose *software: None of the above* and your OS and follow the installation instructions.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install certbot
```

### Generate certificate using DNS validation

- [Reference](https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#manual)

Make sure your DNS supports the Let's Encrypt CAA by verifying that it has this field in its platform variables:

```yaml
  ADVANCED_API_SETTINGS:
    optional: true
    name: "Advanced API settings"
    settings:
      SSL_CAA_ISSUER:
        value: letsencrypt.org
        description: "Certificate authority allowed to issue SSL certificates for this domain"
```

If you are not familiar with this process, it is recommended to do a dry-run as the Let's Encrypt API has a call limit, which may block you in case of multiple failed attempts.
For this, append `--dry-run` to the command below. Once it works, simply repeat it without `--dry-run`.

Launch the process using:

```bash
certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges dns
```

When prompted for the domain, enter `*.${DOMAIN}` and accept to share the IP address by pressing `ENTER`.

Now, the CLI will ask you to set a certain key to the TXT Record `_acme-challenge`. Enter it in the platform variables by adding the following field as following:

```yaml
  DNS_SETTINGS:
    name: "DNS settings"
    settings:
      DNS_CUSTOM_ENTRIES:
        description: "Additional DNS entries. See the DNS configuration document: https://pryv.github.io/customer-resources/#guides-and-documents.
        Can be set to null if not used."
        value:
          _acme-challenge:
            description: "KEY"
```

And reboot the follower and Pryv.io services, using either method:

- On each follower machine, run:
  ```bash
  ./restart-config-follower
  ./restart-pryv
  ```
- From the admin panel web app, push 'Update'

Verify that the key is querying the name servers.

If you are running a single-node platform or cluster with a single DNS, you can run:

```bash
dig @reg.${DOMAIN} TXT _acme-challenge.${DOMAIN}
```

If you are running a cluster platform with more than one DNS, run:

```bash
dig @${NS1_HOSTNAME} TXT _acme-challenge.${DOMAIN}
dig @${NS2_HOSTNAME} TXT _acme-challenge.${DOMAIN}
```

Once you get the right key, go back to the CLI and press ENTER.

You should now have a certificate in `/etc/letsencrypt/live/${DOMAIN}/`.

### Reorganize SSL certificate files

Rename the files to match the NGINX settings:

```bash
mv fullchain.pem ${DOMAIN}-bundle.crt
mv privkey.pem ${DOMAIN}-key.pem
```

You might have to copy them as `live/` holds symbolic links.

Then copy them into:

```bash
${PRYV_CONF_ROOT}/config-leader/data/${ROLE}/nginx/conf/secret/
```

with `${ROLE}` being:

- `singlenode`

OR

- `core`
- `reg-master`
- `reg-slave`
- `static`

Make sure that the certificates permissions are set correctly:

```bash
./ensure-permissions[-${ROLE}] --ignore-redis
```

And reboot the follower and pryv services, using either method:

- On each follower machine, run:
  ```bash
  ./restart-config-follower
  ./restart-pryv
  ```
- From the admin panel web app, push 'Update'

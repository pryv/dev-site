# recâˆ™la server API documentation

Markdown sources for the server API documentation.

TODO: update this README after reviewing the documentation's status and cleaning up Gollum-related files. The original README content follows:

This is a Gollum wiki folder (https://github.com/github/gollum).
See UsingGollumFR.md for instructions (in French...) on using Gollum locally.

Note that you can of course edit the Markdown content via your favourite Markdown editor instead (TextMate, Byword,
etc.), and git-commit by hand.

About file names, as long as Gollum is used for edition (we shall switch to more URL-friendly conventions when publishing later):

  * `Home` and `_Sidebar` are special Gollum names and must be kept as is

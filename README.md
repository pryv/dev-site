# Pryv API (developers) website

API reference, recommendations, guides, etc.


## Temporary note

A lot of files in are only there for our temporary teaser page. This will have to be cleaned up when the full site get publication-ready.


## Writing documentation

Try to stick to the following guidelines when writing (these guidelines are meant to be updated and completed as we progress):

- **Use "you"**: We're speaking to third-party app developers, who are playing an invaluable role in building the Pryv ecosystem. Let's address them personally.
- **Use the feminine form for users and other indeterminate cases**: Our domain is masculine enough; let's help balance that whenever we can. (See [Faruk Ate≈ü's good article on the topic](http://www.netmagazine.com/features/primer-sexism-tech-industry).)
- **Clarity comes first, but friendliness is next** (and humor is allowed): It's an API doc, but we write it for human beings; simple and unambiguous language does not prevent a friendly tone. (Your own peculiar) Humor is encouraged (maybe best in examples' data).
- **Take the diversity of third-party apps dev stacks into account**: Don't assume everyone is using Javascript; Pryv apps can be written with any dev stack.


## Setting up the development environment

`make setup`


## Working & building

- `make server` runs a small server serving the generated website during development development
- `make compile` generates the website from the source into the `build` folder
- `scripts/update-api-version.bash` automatically updates the API version from a nearby `api-server` repo (assuming `../api-server/package.json` to exist from the present repo's root)


## Publishing

The website is published with GitHub pages. To update it, after making sure your changes in the sources are committed and the generated website files are up-to-date (see the instructions on generating the files), simply:

1. Go to the `build` folder (which is a working copy of the appropriate repo branch)
2. Commit the changes to the generated files
3. Push (to 'master': `git push`)
